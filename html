                            Hi I’m Shargene, I am a creative frontend developer based in Chicago, IL. My passion is
                            discovering solutions through the unity of the logical and creative. Designing and building
                            websites that tell a story that keep a user engaged and reoccurring. Outside of creative work, I enjoy adventures with my
                            family, architecture, being active, music.

                            <p class="p-cont show-on-scroll text-fade-left">Hello, my name is Shargene Zangana, I am a passionate creator who enjoys the process of solving problems by merging the creative and the logical. I love to tell a story through the creative movement and making it a reality by applying a cognitive structure. I was drawn to the field of computer science because, just as in architecture or music, I saw the interactive magic of the analytic and visionary. It offered challenges that not only would develop my technical and artistic skills but also begin to demonstrate a deeper substance of quantum and metaphysical proportion.  </p>

                            <p class="p-cont">Solid, Useful, Beautiful. </p>

                            <p class="p-cont show-on-scroll text-fade-right">This quote comes from the roman architect Marcus Vitruvius in his famous architectural book De Architectura, which is a requirement in an architectural education. I would realize that this quote would also apply to many applications of life but more notably in the field of computer science.  A fabrication, software, or code must be solid in that it is secure from errors, vulnerability, and operates to its primary function. A creation or UI/UX must be useful, in that the interface is easily operated and can be utilized to generate more attraction or traffic to the application. Finally, it must be beautiful, our phycology is to be attracted to alluring images, colors, and textures. It is what draws the eyes to the application. It commands one’s attention and entices our senses. It will keep the user engaged. </p>

                            <p class="p-cont">My Goals and Ambition </p>

                            <p class="p-cont show-on-scroll text-fade-left">

                                I am looking to work on projects or to join a team to develop my learning to higher plains to in turn create projects that make this world a better place. In doing so, to help people, whether it be clients or team members, make their dreams a reality through our work. 
                                I enjoy learning new tools that produce the best possible out come to a project. I have built websites from scratch, worked with minimal code platforms, and no code platform. As in life there is no one piece fits all to a project and enjoy utilizing all available tools to solve a project's program. </p>

                            <p class="p-cont show-on-scroll text-fade-right"> Currently, as I continue to develop my
                                frontend knowledge, I am also beginning to learn backend tools such as mongo DB to
                                develop a application that would help those struggling with motivation during the Covid
                                epidemic. </p>

                            <p class="p-cont show-on-scroll text-fade-left">When I'm not working on my programming skills, I enjoy adventures with my family such as exploring the sites of Chicago, designing architectural work, and watching movies. My hobbies are playing soccer, music, astronomy and long walks in nature (particularly at night to watch the stars). 
                            </p>

                            <p>ZZ's Produce is an international mom-and-pop grocery store that offers produce and groceries from around the world. Their principal belief is to provide a global product at an affordable price. They contacted me to develop a site that would represent a clean and fresh sensation that represented thier stores concept. One of the requirements was a consideration that most of thier costumers were of international backgrounds and typically unfamiliar with the area. Along with location issues, we had to account for the site's users would be international speaking. Meaning that the site could be accessible to vast range of cultures. </p>

To pay respect to his roots, the hero image is that of a mountain with a glass filter on overlayed to create a memory feel. On the desktop hero design, his last name falls behind the glass filter to symbolize his journey forward yet part of him always back home. For the color palette, the colors of his country, Kurdistan, were chosen. The character of the site is that of Zana’s many relic books that he sources in his work with a modernist approach.  </p>
